# MetaSite Experimental Project

Has no affiliation with Meta.

MetaSite is a site that tries to be meta. Not too meta though â€“ just a little bit.

Essentially, this is an experimental website using basic pages and text, but organised in a spatial manner, as if regressing somewhat to a physical organisation of pieces of paper. Navigation is currently mainly provided by arrows displayed on the sides of pages.

Contact L3#4623 on Discord if interested in the project, working on something similar, working on something dissimilar, or not working on anything.
